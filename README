The sliders are assigned to pins and rgb groups by sliders.h.

Libraries:
http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/arduino_libraries/MsTimer2.zip

Put these in libraries/RobTillaartRunningAverage:
https://github.com/RobTillaart/Arduino/blob/master/libraries/RunningAverage/RunningAverage.cpp
https://github.com/RobTillaart/Arduino/blob/master/libraries/RunningAverage/RunningAverage.h

To generate patches.h:

* Install ipython notebook, for python 2
 * Windows
  * Install Python2 (was 2.7.9 when I looked, whatever is the newest 2.7.x)
    https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
     Python 2.7.9 - 2014-12-10
         Download Windows x86 MSI installer
  * Install "pip"
   * it claims "pip" comes with python 2.7.9, 
    * Test for it:
    from a batch window, type:
        pip --help
    or
        pip /help
    It should be obvious               
    * if not get it from
    https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html
  * Install ipython notebook with pip (cf. http://ipython.org/install.html)
    from a batch window, type:
        pip install "ipython[notebook]"
    Lots of stuff should install.
    I'm expecting ipython... 3.0.x
 * Linux
    apt-get python2.7 python2.7-dev libzmq-dev
    pip install --upgrade pyzmq tornado jinja2 jsonschema
    sudo chmod -R a+r /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages

* Start the ipython-notebook server
    * windows, in a batch window, type:
        ipython notebook
    * Open a new'ish browser:
        http://127.0.0.1:8888
    * Download/drab the patchGenerate.ipynb to the window as directed
