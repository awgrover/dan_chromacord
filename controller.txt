TO drive light-paintings.
#define PERFORMANCE 0
Hook the "tlc59711<->controller" cable into the tlc.

4 zones, 4 "channels", 4 sets controllers

1. The Every has to be powered (via the 12/5v regulator), so it can do the D4 pull up/down pin. The Every needs to have a recent light-painting code loaded (so it does D4).

2. Add a TLC GND to perfboard GND.

3. Label the perfboard locations of the CI & DI wires (for easy reattach). Putting all 4 wires from the Every on a header would be nice....

On the Chromaccord:

1. It will start in a marching red. This shows the 4 zones are working. (use 's' to show the zones).

2. Move the third slider at least 2cm to exit attractor/red mode. OR change either right-two "patch" knobs.

3. Set the right two patch knobs to "0" (up).

4. Sliders are ordered left-to-right: BGR.

5. Open the serial console (15200 baud).

6. Play with sliders to explore colors.

7. Turn either right two patch knobs to non-0 to freeze the color, and freeze the serial console. Read off the colors (copy/paste).

8. Sadly, the serial console is RGB not BGR. And, apparently not full range (especially the first slider)?

9. Left most sliders appear to be zone 0.

In the serial console:
* type 'b' to blink zone 1 (actually just red/green I think).
* type 's' to run the sequence once (to check zones):
	zone 0 red
	zone 1 green
	zone 2 yellow'ish
	zone 3 blue
* type 'g' to go back to slider-zone mode.
* the system may lock up, hit reset button.

We can make changes:
* what order should the sliders be? rgb or bgr? Or hsv?
* what range should be printed? 0..65535 ? 0.0 .. 1.0 ?
* print in a different format? closer to something to paste into code?
